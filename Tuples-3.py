Tuple Items
Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

Ordered
When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unchangeable
Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
